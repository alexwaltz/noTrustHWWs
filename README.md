# How to NOT trust hardware wallets

Here you can find the slides for my [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXbtE33Aeb4) at the [Bitcoinology meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Bitcoinology/events/283003539/)

To create and present, the presentation I used [beautifull.ai](https://www.beautiful.ai/). This is a very cool tool to make presentations the only drawback being that its an online tool.
You can play the slides same way I did when I presenting by going to https://www.beautiful.ai/player/-Mt4WHwrsFx-a0bisXnN/notHWWs

In the "Screenshoots of slides" folder you will find screenshoots and videos(where is the case) of the slides in the presentation, this should allos you to use this in a PowerPoint, if you please to do so.
However the problem here is that you can't edit them.

In the "Media used in presentation" folder you will find all the media files that I used for the presentation.
Most of them are taken by me and look actually pretty good and they are high-quality.
